### Day 1: July 04, 2018

#### Task : Creating a REST API with Vert.x
#### Progress: 

I started learning Vert.x framework by Eclipse recent. And I had already created a project with Vert.x to create REST API. Basic skeleton of the project is already done. I have yet to do the improvements, such as backing the API with a MySql db, improve the REST endpoints of the API. As the first day of the challenge I plan to add MySQL support to the API. Created a test implementation for MySql, also improved the REST endpoints by allowing headers and HTTP methods.

### Day 3: July 06, 2018

#### Task : Creating a REST API with Vert.x
#### Progress: 

JDBC configuration updated and managed to retrive data from the DB with async JDBC client. Still some parts are confusing, specially with the callbacks. Need to look futher into Java's "Future" and Vert.x "Future".

### Day 4: July 07, 2018

#### Task : Creating a REST API with Vert.x
#### Progress: 

Managed to generalize the DB methods to support generic queries upto an extent. Needs further improvements. Refactored the architechture of the project. But not satisfied with it. Need to look into it more. Or possibly get expert advice on the matter.

All REST end points for one service are completed. API seems to be working ok. Need to add a proper error handling mechanism. Also architecture needs to be changed.
