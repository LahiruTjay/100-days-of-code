### Day 1: July 04, 2018

#### Task : Creating a REST API with Vert.x
#### Progress: 

I started learning Vert.x framework by Eclipse recent. And I had already created a project with Vert.x to create REST API. Basic skeleton of the project is already done. I have yet to do the improvements, such as backing the API with a MySql db, improve the REST endpoints of the API. As the first day of the challenge I plan to add MySQL support to the API. Created a test implementation for MySql, also improved the REST endpoints by allowing headers and HTTP methods.
